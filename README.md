# HELLLLLOOOOOO

I appreciate you taking the time to check out this repo, but this course ([Backend Brilliance: REST APIs, Node, Express and Mongo Made Easy](https://mammothclub.com/course/backend-brilliance-rest-apis-node-express-mongodb)) appears to be extremely outdated. It was part of a packaged bundled and whew boy. I've decided to work with a different backend course.

What was that? Oh, just some tumbleweed. We get that from time to time in these forsaken repos. Just ignore it.

Bye! ðŸ‘‹
