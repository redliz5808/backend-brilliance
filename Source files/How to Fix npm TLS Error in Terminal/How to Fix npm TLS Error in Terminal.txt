Are you seeing this message in your Terminal (Command Line) application when using npm?
Remove warning ‘Beginning October 4, 2021, all connections to the npm registry - including for package installation - must use TLS 1.2 or higher. You are currently using plaintext http to connect. Please visit the GitHub blog for more information: https://github.blog/2021-08-23-npm-registry-deprecating-tls-1-0-tls-1-1/’
Solution
Enter the following in your Terminal:
npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/
Some computers are still running with http://registry.npmjs.org, which is not going to be allowed anymore for security reasons.
